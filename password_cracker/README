# Password Cracker CLI

Prepared by: Rust Bridge Guayaquil 2025

---

## Context

Password security is a fundamental pillar in protecting digital information.  
Understanding how passwords can be compromised is crucial to strengthening security systems.  
This project focuses on building a command-line tool capable of performing brute-force or dictionary attacks to crack passwords, helping to understand vulnerabilities and the importance of strong passwords.

---

## Project Description

Build a command-line application to crack passwords using a wordlist and hashing algorithms like MD5.  
This project will introduce you to file handling, the use of cryptographic libraries, and implementing concurrency through threads to optimize performance.

---

## What You Will Build

A terminal-based application that allows users to:

1. Read hashed and salted passwords from a file
2. Read a wordlist (list of words) from a file
3. Crack passwords using hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5)
4. Use threads to speed up the cracking process
5. Report the cracked passwords

## Features

### Core Features

1. **Wordlist Loading**  
   Read words from a text file to use as potential passwords.

2. **Hashing Support**  
   Implement the ability to hash text strings using libraries such as `md5`.

3. **Cracking Algorithm**  
   Compare hashes of the words from the wordlist with the target hash.

4. **Thread Handling**  
   Use threads to split the wordlist and process parts of it concurrently.

5. **Result Reporting**  
   Display the cracked passwords along with their hashes.

### Advanced Features

1. **Multiple Hashing Algorithms**  
   Support for additional hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.).

2. **Brute-Force Attacks**  
   Generate character combinations when the password is not found in the wordlist.

3. **Salt Handling**  
   Support for passwords with salt (a random string added to the hash).

4. **Progress and Statistics**  
   Show cracking progress and statistics (e.g., words processed per second).

5. **Improved User Interface**  
   Clear command-line options and robust error handling.

## Expected Outcome

A functional CLI tool for password cracking that demonstrates:

- The importance of using complex passwords
- The efficiency of concurrent programming for compute-intensive tasks
